Beyond the fact that this is a world changing project, there're a few features to be added and worked on to make user experience perfect, like Adding a help/support link below the beyond bridge to help users who are having a slow pace navigating the bridge, or are having slight complications with loading up their wallet addresses, because my first experience using the bridge was to get a testnet, while I'm stil a newbie but a fast learner haha, it took me two days to understand that it wasn't actually my wallet address that had an issue but i was getting the process wrong, so if there was a quick help/support link to help users easily navigate through the bridging system, it'll be an effective feature upgrade. # ‚Çøeyond Feedback üí°
